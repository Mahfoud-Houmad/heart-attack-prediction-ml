# Heart Attack Risk Prediction 

This repository contains a Machine Learning project to predict heart attack risks using clinical data. All technical details, EDA, and model evaluations are documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

##  Project Highlights
- **Objective:** Predicting cardiac risk through binary classification.
- **Models Evaluated:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and **XGBoost** (Final Model).
- **Dataset Source:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Cycle=2017-2018).

##  Repository Structure
- `codeSource.ipynb/`: Full analysis and model training logic.
- `models/`: Saved `.pkl` files (Model & Scaler).
- `requirements.txt`: Necessary Python dependencies.

##  Quick Start
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
